# International Tourism Data Analysis Report

## Overview
This project involved an in-depth analysis of international tourism data from the World Bank to uncover insights into tourism trends and performance of different countries. By manipulating and visualizing the data in R, I gained proficiency in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Sources
The data was sourced from the World Development Indicators dataset provided by the World Bank. It included information on international tourism metrics like number of arrivals, departures, tourism revenue, GDP, etc. for countries globally from 2009-2019.

## Data Wrangling
- Imported required packages like tidyverse, ggplot2, rnaturalearth.
- Loaded World Bank data into R and performed initial cleaning.
- Filtered and grouped data to focus on relevant countries and metrics for analysis.
- Reshaped data from wide to long format for time series visualizations.
- Joined data with geographic shapefiles for mapping.

 ## Analysis and Visualizations
- Created maps, scatterplots, bar charts, line graphs, and other visuals for insights.
- Compared tourism performance across countries and regions.
- Analyzed the relationship of tourism with economic factors like GDP.
- Examined trends over time by income level and geographic region.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Importing, cleaning, filtering, grouping, joining, and reshaping data with R
- Data manipulation using dplyr package
- Joining data sources for integrated analysis
- Creating static and interactive visualizations with ggplot2
- Producing maps and custom graphics to reveal insights
- Implementing analysis and models to answer research questions
- Communicating data narratives effectively through visualizations
